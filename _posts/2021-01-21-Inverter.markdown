In the fall of 2018 I took 6.332, an extension of 6.334, Graduate Power Electronics. This class, like .334, had a final project however it was completely open-ended, the project just had to be related to power electronics. I chose to write the firmware for a three phase motor controller using field oriented control (FOC). Being on FSAE, I was always interested in how our off-the-shelf motor controllers worked and wanted to see if I could create my own. The project ended up being pretty time consuming with lots of bugs to chase out but eventually I got the motor to spin. I wrote up a report on FOC and my experiences and you can read it [here](/documents/6.332_Report.pdf). The motor used was a 650 kv propdrive motor, the microcontroller was an STM32F413 (the same used on FSAE), and the power electronics were embedded on a nucleo <a href="http://st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-ihm001.html" target="_blank"><u>shield</u></a>
